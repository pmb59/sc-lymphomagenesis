# Single cell and multi-omics analyses of lymphomagenesis

This repository contains scripts and workflows for analyzing omics data of

- 10X Single-cell RNA-Seq of B220+ splenocytes from four longitudinal stages of disease evolution in mouse
- bulk RNA-Seq
- ChIP-seq
- acetylproteomics
- metabolomics


in a project studying lymphoma evolution. The project aims to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying lymphomagenesis and identify new targets for therapy.

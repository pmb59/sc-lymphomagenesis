# Single Cell and Multi-Omics Analyses of Lymphomagenesis

This repository contains scripts and workflows for analyzing omics data, including:

- 10X Single-cell RNA-Seq of B220+ splenocytes from four longitudinal stages of disease evolution in mouse
- bulk RNA-Seq
- ChIP-seq
- acetylproteomics

This project studies lymphoma evolution. It aims to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying lymphomagenesis and identify new targets for therapy.
